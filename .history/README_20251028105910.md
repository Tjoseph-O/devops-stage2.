# DevOps Stage 2 - Blue/Green Deployment with Nginx

## Overview
This project implements a Blue/Green deployment pattern with automatic failover using Nginx and Docker Compose. When the primary (Blue) service fails, Nginx automatically routes traffic to the backup (Green) service with zero downtime.

## Architecture
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy with automatic failover (port 8080)
- **Blue App**: Primary application instance (port 8081)
- **Green App**: Backup application instance (port 8082)

## Prerequisites
- Docker 20.10 or higher
- Docker Compose 1.29 or higher
- curl (for testing)

## Quick Start
